#### About
This app allows interactive exploration of transcription factor (TF) and pathway activites of perturbation and disease experiments in mice and humans. As part of the publication <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/532739v1" target="_blank">Transfer of regulatory knowledge from human to mouse for functional genomic analysis</a> we analyzed 454 single drug perturbation, 1451 single gene perturbation and 469 disease experiments

* We used the tool <a href="https://saezlab.github.io/progeny/" target="_blank">PROGENy</a> to infer the activity of 14 signaling pathways from gene expression data. PROGENy is based on consensus transcriptomic perturbation signatures we refer to as footprints of signaling pathways on gene expression.

* To infer the activity of TFs we used <a href="https://saezlab.github.io/DoRothEA/" target="_blank">DoRothEA</a> which is a resource matching TFs with their corresponding targets. This resource allows the estimation of TF activity from gene expression data by enriched regulon analysis.

#### Gene expression data source & data availability
We downloaded the transcriptomic data from GEO based on well defined experiment annotations provided by <a href="http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/CREEDS/" target="_blank">CREEDS</a>. TF and pathway activites of single experiment or the entire resource can be downloaded within this app. Associated metadata can be downloaded as well.
