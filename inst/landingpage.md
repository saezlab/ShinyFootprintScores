#### Welcome
##### About
This app allows interactive exploration of transcription factor (TF) and pathway activites of perturbation and disease experiments in mice and humans. In total we analyzed 454 single drug perturbation, 1451 single gene perturbation and 469 disease experiments

* We used the tool <a href="https://saezlab.github.io/progeny/" target="_blank">PROGENy</a> to infer the activity of 14 signaling pathways from gene expression data. PROGENy is based on consensus transcriptomic perturbation signatures we refer to as footprints of signaling pathways on gene expression.

* To infer the activity of TFs we used <a href="https://saezlab.github.io/DoRothEA/" target="_blank">DoRothEA</a> which is a resource matching TFs with their corresponding targets. This resource allows the estimation of TF activity from gene expression data by enriched regulon analysis.

##### Gene expression data source & data availability
We downloaded the transcriptomic data from GEO based on well defined experiment annotations provided by <a href="http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/CREEDS/" target="_blank">CREEDS</a>. TF and pathway activites of single experiment or the entire resource can be downloaded within this app. Associated metadata can be downloaded as well.
