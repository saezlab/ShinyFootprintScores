### Selection of CREEDS or GEO IDs

***
With this widget you can select your experiment of interested either based on a [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) or a [CREEDS](https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/CREEDS/) ID. 

***
CREEDS IDs map always to a **single** perturbation experiment, whereas GEO IDs can contain up to **multiple** perturbation experiments.

Example: *Given a drug perturbation experiment with 3 different concentrations - each individual concentration is considered as perturbation (sub-)experiment and thus captured by a single CREEDS ID while all three experiments together are captured by the GEO ID.*

***
CREEDS IDs encode information about the underlying experiments. IDs in the format:

* `gene:xxx` refer to gene perturbation experiments
* `drug:xxx` refer to drug pertubation experiments
* `dz:xxx` refer to disease signatures
