### Select disease ontology(s)

***
Instead of a single disease also disease ontologies can be selected which can compromise various diseases:

For example the disease ontology `Liver Cirrhosis` contains the diseases `Alcoholic Liver Cirrhosis` and `Primary Billary Cirrhosis`.
An overview of disease ontologies is available [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/doid).

***
**Note**: Selecting disease ontologies will *disable* the picker widget for single diseases and vice versa.
