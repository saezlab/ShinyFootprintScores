The content of this widget is dependent on the selected resource.

* `Drug perturbation:` A list of applied drug 
* `Gene perturbation:` A list of targeted genes
* `Disease signatures:` A list of investigated diseases

***
If `Disease signatures` has been selected as resource, an additional widget will appear that allows to explore experiments based on disease ontologies. **Note:** only one picker widget can be active at the same time. Hence, the disase ontology picker will be disable when already a single disease is selected and vice versa.
