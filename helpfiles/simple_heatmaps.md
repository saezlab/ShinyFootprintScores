### Heatmaps of pathway and transcription factor activities

***
The heatmaps are showing pathway and transcription factor activities with pathways/TF in columns and perturbation experiment in rows. High positive activity scores are indicated by red and high negative activity scores are indicated by blue color.
Corresponding metadata and raw activity scores of the perturbation experiments are provided in the table above and below, respectively.

***
The heatmaps are interactive so that you can:

* zoom into the figure in case that some TF names are not readable.
* hover with the mouse over any tile to retrieve the actual activity score.
